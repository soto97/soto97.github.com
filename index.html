      <h2>A planetary scientist attempting to do it right, software-engineering-wise.</h2>

      <section class="intro">
	  <p>I am a planetary scientist who works with large and complex general circulation models. I am on GitHub in an attempt to use the software engineering tradecraft to improve my coding and manage my models. The goal is to spend all of my time thinking about science, so anything that helps minimize the non-science work is great. </p>

	<h2><span>The Job</span></h2>
	<p>I currently work at the <a href="http://www.boulder.swri.edu">Southwest Research Institute</a> in Boulder, CO. Using both general circulation models and mesoscale models, I simulate the atmospheres of terrestrial planets in order to understand the physics that drive and control the atmospheric phenomena that we see on terrestrial planets in our solar system. My <a href="http://www.alejandrosoto.net">web page</a> has more details on my work and recent news.</p>
